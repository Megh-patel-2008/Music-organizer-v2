Project: music-organizer-v2. A project to collect audio files.
Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 4.

To start:

Create a MusicOrganizer object on the object bench.
Use its methods to add, remove, and play files.

Questions:

17.When adding a new file make sure its in the audio files of the chapter and when calling for an unknown
   file it will display that there was a problem with the files name
18.The header might look somethuing like this: public vois listAllFiles()
   The return type would be void and there would no parameters.
19.I would notbe possible because files keep getting added and so if we were to do something like this
   we would have to replace the numbers by the parameter "index"
